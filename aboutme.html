								<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I believe I would be an ideal candidate for a Genie based on my broad experience working with people in both a teaching role (professor/student relationship) and in a service industry professional role (serving people as a bartender and waiter) as well as the wide array of people that consider me a confidante. I see a lot of genius in the concept behind Genie. At one time or another everyone has had an issue that they would love to share with a trusted person. Often they resort to only internalize it because they didn’t want to bother a friend, or, on the other end of the spectrum, go see a therapist.  I think talking to someone that can recognize the emotions in play, identify their source, and take an objective perspective on all contributing factors can make the day-to-day decision making process much less cumbersome, and that’s where I see the beauty in Genie.</p>
								<p>I’ve always considered myself a passionate generalist, applying the 80/20 Pareto principle to most of my interests.  I like to think I’m knowledgeable enough to hold a conversation with anybody on just about anything. I think this stems from an insatiable curiosity in the world around us. While curiosity and logic attracted me to the sciences, my real passion has always been people. By pairing that curiosity and logic with an acute social perception and applying them to human interactions and networks I’m able to delve into what makes people tick. </p>
								<p>I believe successful people have a well-honed ability to spot disingenuous intentions. I believe my genuine interest in people allows me to have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period of time. 3+ years of listening to people’s problems from behind a bar helps to hone that skill as well. I think my value as a Genie comes from my ability to use my intuition, empathy, and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.</p>
